# Collaborative-Media-Creation

This project combines multi-device video capture, high-quality audio mixing from a soundboard, and AI-driven editing to produce professional, dynamic videos of live events. By using a local Mac mini as the on-premises server and processing hub, you can minimize network overhead and retain control of your data.
